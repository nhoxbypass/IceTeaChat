## Notes

There are still some bugs in my application due to Google update new Firebase. The legacy firebase doesn't have more supports.

## Open-source libraries used

- [Legacy Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) - The tools and infrastructure you need to build better apps and grow successful businesses
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling
- [Circle ImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) - A circular ImageView for Android
